Craft Beer Database
'''
Welcome to the Craft Beer Database.  This database relies on craft beer taken from https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans.
To properly launch the database, please do the following:
1. Download the breweries.csv and beers.csv files.
2. Download finalproject.py
3. In your terminal, run the command 'python3 finalproject.py breweries.csv beers.csv'.
It is important that you run the command for breweries and beers in this order because we are taking sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] for analysis.
If you run it backwards, your breweries will be beers and your beers will be breweries.
Have fun...thank you!
